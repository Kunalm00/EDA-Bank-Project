# EDA-Bank-Project
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore customer data related to bank subscriptions and analyze customer behaviors using the Pandas framework. The dataset includes information about customers' demographics, financial behaviors, and interaction with bank marketing campaigns. The insights derived from this analysis will help in making data-driven decisions to enhance customer acquisition strategies, improve marketing efforts, and understand customer preferences.

Goals of the Project
1.	Explore the bank subscription dataset using Pandas.
2.	Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3.	Perform feature engineering to derive useful insights related to customer behavior.
4.	Visualize trends and distributions of key variables like age, balance, duration, and subscription status.
5.	Summarize key findings that can aid in business decision-making, such as strategies to target potential customers for term deposits.
   
Technologies Used
 
The following libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:
1.	NumPy – For numerical computations and handling arrays.
2.	Pandas – For data analysis, cleaning, and manipulation.
3.	Matplotlib – For creating basic data visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line plots.
4.	Seaborn – For statistical visualizations like stacked bar charts and heatmaps.
